#### LPK12/CStats - students learning and teachers’ PD. Reports on empirical findings on how students learn computing and STEM content and how teachers understand and enact logic-based integrated curricula can be found below. The data we used includes students’ class work, clinical interviews, video recordings of class/PD meetings from classroom implementations and professional development workshops. Qualitative analyses are the major means we used in our study.

#### Assessment Instrument Development. Given that traditional computing assessments do not adequately capture learning outcomes such as abstraction and logical reasoning in integrated contexts, this work addresses a critical gap. The instrument is developed and validated following a rigorous assessment development and validation process, including argument-based validation.

#### Systematic reviews on integration of Computing and STEM (STEM+C). These studies identify the progress and gaps in existing research. We found a lack of principled theoretical frameworks guiding integrated curriculum development. Our LPK12 framework and its extension may play a role in addressing the gap
